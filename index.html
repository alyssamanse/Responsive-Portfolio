			<img class="headshot" src="assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="alyssa manse headshot">
			<p class="bio-text">I was born in St. Louis, Missouri but have called Austin, Texas home for more than 15 years. I attended <span class="ut">The University of Texas at Austin</span> and graduated in 2013 with a B.A. in Psychology and a minor in Business Administration.</p>
			<p class="bio-text">After graduation, I worked at a non-profit for poverty alleviation through microcredit within Whole Foods Market focusing on student outreach. I left Whole Foods to begin working at UT Austin and am now the Project Coordinator for multiple software shared campus-wide.</p>
			<p class="bio-text">I am interested in gaining the skills that will allow me to have more freedom financially as well as the freedom to combine my talent with my passions.</p>
			<p class="bio-text">When I'm not working, I enjoy yoga, cycling, making my way through the best of Austin's happy hour specials and watching documentaries or B-horror films. I am also a self-described crazy dog lady and my fur baby Copper is my favorite human.</p>
